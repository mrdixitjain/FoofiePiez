This is a college project to design a Food Delivery Website.
It allows a restaurant to control various aspects and also, it allows same for customers.

Currently only COD is kept as payment method and Search is based on keywords only.
There is no use of any APIs.

In future, there might be updates using APIs for location search, measuring distances etc.

Also, currently there is no implementation for the delivery partners.
So, an order will be in out for delivery state and won't be delivered :).
Though in future, one may try and implement this as per their need.
