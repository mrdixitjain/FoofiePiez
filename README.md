This is a college project to design a Food Delivery Website.
It allows a restaurant to control various aspects and also, it allows same for customers.

Currently only COD is kept as payment method and Search is based on keywords only.
There is no use of any APIs.

In future, there might be updates using APIs for location search, measuring distances etc.
